        <p>My name is Mitchell Foley, I am an 11th grade student at Millard South High School, in Omaha Nebraska. Although I am currently enrolled as a student at Millard South, last year I attended Shenendahoah High, in Clifton Park, NY, for a period of time. Recently I joined the Avenue Scholars program, through which I plan to prepare myself for my future career of Art directing, and to train myself for educational success.</p>
