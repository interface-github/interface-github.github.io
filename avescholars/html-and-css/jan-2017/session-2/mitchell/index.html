Although I currently attend Millard South, last year, i was a High School student at Shenendahoah High, in Clifton Park, NY, for a period of time. Recently I joined the Avenue Scholars program, through which I plan to prepare myself for my future career of Art directing, and to train myself for educational success.</p>
