        <p id="green-paragraph"> I was strolling through the amazon and all the sudden I started beefing with a mountian lion. We fell to the ground and started wrestling. He called his buddy the big bear and I ran for my life. In the process I tripped over a rock I was beefing with. Thank goodness Teana carried me up hills both way to the hospital 10 miles way. </p>
